\section{Scheme sites}
%TODO: come up with other name. Last to do of this section
%TODO: define (big) Zariski site.
%TODO: define inclusion of small zariski site into big zariski site.
%TODO: Proof that stilde = \widetilde on the small site
%TODO: Proof that \stilde on the big site restricts to \stilde on the big site
%TODO: Proof that sheaf is qc on big site iff it is qc on the small site.
%TODO: Proof that if sheaf is \stilde after restricting, then it is \stilde on the big site

%TODO: MAYBE Qcoh(small) = Qcoh(big/X) by pulling back to schemes that are not opens.
