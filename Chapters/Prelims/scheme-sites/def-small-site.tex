\begin{definition}[Small Zariski site]\label[definition]{Small Zariski site}
Let $X$ be a scheme.
Define the small Zariski ringed site of $X$
to be $\rsite{\opens{X}}{T}{O}$ with the following components.
The underlying category is $\opens{X}$.
The topology $\top{T}$ is generated by the families $\set{D(f_i) \rightarrow \Spec{R}=U}$
where $(f_i) = R$ with $f_i\in R$ for any open affine $\Spec{R} \subset X$.
The sheaf of rings is just the sheaf of rings coming from $X$.
This sheaf is already defined on $\opens{X}$.
