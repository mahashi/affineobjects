\begin{lemma}
Consider $k: smallsite \rightarrow bigsite/X$.
Then $\direct{K}\stilde = \stilde$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
%TODO: proof
% important components: terminal to terminal so domain of both stildes is the same.
% k is like an homeomorphism TODO: look for right definition
\end{proof}

%TODO: Proof that stilde commutes with any bijection of covers, so also with k
