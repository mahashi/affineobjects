\begin{definition}[Spectrum of a ring]\label[definition]{Spectrum of a ring}
Let $R$ be a ring.
The spectrum $\Spec R$ of $R$ is the locally ringed space defined as follows.
The underlying set is the set of prime ideals of $R$.
The (Zariski) topology is generated 
by the basis of distinguised opens $D(f) = \set{\Ip \subset R | f\not\in\Ip}$.
The sheaf of rings is given on this basis by 
\[D(f) \mapsto R_f.\]

A distinguised open $D(f)$ of $\Spec{R}$ 
viewed as locally ringed space is isomorphic to $\Spec{R_f}$,
where the inclusion $D(f) \rightarrow \Spec{R}$ corresponds to the canonical map $R \rightarrow R_f$.
