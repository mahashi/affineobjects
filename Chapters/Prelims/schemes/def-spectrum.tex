\begin{definition}[Spectrum of a ring]
Let $R$ be a ring.
The spectrum $\Spec R$ of $R$ is the ringed space defined as follows.
The underlying set is the set of prime ideals of $R$.
The (zariski) topology is generated by the basis $D(f) = \set{\Ip \subset R | f\not\in\Ip}$.
The sheaf of rings is given by 
\[D(f) \mapsto R_f.\]
