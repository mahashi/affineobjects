\begin{definition}[Scheme]\label[definition]{Scheme}
We call the locally ringed space $\Spec{R}$ an affine scheme.

A scheme $S$ is a locally ringed space that admits a covering of affine schemes.
A morphism of schemes is a morphism of locally ringed spaces.
The category of schemes we will denote by $\schemes$.

When we define a sheaf $\sheaf{F}$ `on' a scheme $S$,
then this means we define this sheaf on the small Zariski site corresponding to $S$.
