\chapter{Preliminaries}

This chapter introduces all the well-known results and notions that are needed for the original material.
We will start with a discussion of some purely categorical notions like over categories and presheaves.
Secondly, we will introduce a notion of a topology on a category and look at some constructions that are relevant for us.
Then we will introduce modules on ringed sites and see how they behave with respect to restricting along a functor.
Lastly, the notion of a scheme is introduced and we establish some properties in the big and small site of a scheme.
