\chapter{Preliminaries}
%Summary
This chapter introduces all the basic notions that are needed but not assumed to be known to the reader.
We will start with a discussion of some purely categorical notions like slice categories and presheaves.
Secondly, we will introduce a notion of a topology on a category and look at some constructions that are relevant for us.
Then we will introduce modules on ringed sites.
Lastly, the notion of a scheme is introduced.
