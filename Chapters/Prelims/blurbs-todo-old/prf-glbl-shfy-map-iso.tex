\begin{lemma}
Let $a$ be caffine.
The global component of the sheafification morphism is equal to the unit of $\adj{\stilde}{\globalsections}$ in $\overcat{C}{a}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $M$ be a $\sections{a}{O}$-module.
Consider the following maps, which you get by repeatedly calling on an adjunction bijection.
Let $i$ be the universal sheafification morphism.

\[\stilde(M) \rightarrow \stilde(M)\]
\[	i : \pstilde(M) \rightarrow \stilde(M) \mbox{ use sheafification adjunction}\]
\[ M \rightarrow \sections{a}{\stilde(M)} \mbox{ use } \adj{\pstilde}{\sections{a}}\]

If you compose the two adjunction bijections used, you get the bijection of $\adj{\stilde}{\sections{a}}$
by definition, so the last map is actually $\unit_M$.
Hence $i_a = \unit_{M}$, which is an iso by assumption.
\end{proof}
