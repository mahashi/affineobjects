It follows that we have the adjunction $\adj{\stilde}{\globalsections}$.

%Give explicitely the unit and co-unit of this adjunction in terms of 
% Let $\sheaf{F}$ be a $\sheaf{O}$-module and $M$ and $R$-module.
% Let $S = \globalsections{F}$
% Consider the unit and co-unit of this adjunction
% \[T = \counit_{\sheaf{F}}: \stilde{\globalsections{F}} \rightarrow \sheaf{F}, \]
% \[g = \unit_{M}: M \rightarrow \globalsections{\stilde{M}}.\]
% I will give the unit and co-unit explicitely.
% We know that $T = I$
% By the universal property of the sheafification, we have $T = T' \circ i$, where $i: \pstilde{\globalsections{F}} \rightarrow \stilde{\globalsections{F}}$ is the sheafification (presheaf)-morphism.
% \[T_a: \sheaf{O}(a) \tensor_{R} \]
