Let $f:b \rightarrow a$.
Let $u$ be the localization functor.

Let $(x_{i,j})$ be a compatible family over $b$ 
in $\presheaf{F}$ on $\overcat{C}{a}$
indexed by covering sieves $S_j, T$.

We have $x_{i,j} \in \section{\dom{i}}{\presheaf{F}}$.
Define $s_c(x) = (x_{i,j})$
where $S_j, T$ are considered as covering sieves on $fg:c\rightarrow a$ now.

Fix $j$. Let $k: z \righarrow \dom{j}$.
We need $(x_{l,jk}) = (x_{p,j})$ where $l\in S_{jk}$ and $p\in k^*S_j$ are both covering sieves.
These compatible families agree on $S_{jk} \cap k^*S_j$, so they are the same because of the equivalence relation in the construction of the sheafification.
