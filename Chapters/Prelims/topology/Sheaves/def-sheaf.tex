\begin{definition}[Sheaves]
Let $\site{C}{T}$ be a site. 
Let $\presheaf{F} \in \presheaves{C}$.

A presheaf that admits a unique amalgamation for every matching family is called a sheaf.
The category $\sheaves{C}$ is the full subcategory in $\presheaves{C}$ of all sheaves.

In other words, 
we call $\presheaf{F}$ a sheaf 
if for each $a \in \cat{C}$ 
and $R\in \top{T}{a}$ 
the map 
\begin{align*}
	\sections{a}{F} 	& \rightarrow \sections{R}{F}\\
	x 					& \mapsto \matchfam{x}{i}{R}
\end{align*}
where $x_i = \presheaf{F}(i)(x)$
is an isomorphism.
