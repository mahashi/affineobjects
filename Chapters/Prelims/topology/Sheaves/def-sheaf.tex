\begin{definition}[Sheaves]
Let $\site{C}{T}$ be a site. 
Let $\presheaf{F} \in \presheaves{C}$.

A presheaf that admits a unique amalgamation for every matching family is called a sheaf.
The category $\sheaves{C}$ is the full subcategory in $\presheaves{C}$  all sheaves. 
Let $\incsh$ be the inclusion functor $\sheaves{C}\rightarrow \presheaves{C}$.

In other words, 
we call $\presheaf{F}$ a sheaf if the map 
\[\presheaf{F}(a) \rightarrow \presheaf{F}(R)\] 
\[ a: x \mapsto \set{ \presheaf{F}(i)(x) }_{i \in R} \]
is an isomorphism.
