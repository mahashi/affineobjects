\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{bb1}
Let $F:\site{C}{T} \rightarrow \site{D}{S}$
be a morphism of sites and lift covers.
Then $\direct{F} \plus = \plus \direct{F}$ 
and hence also $\direct{F} \circ \sheafify = \sheafify \circ \direct{F}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $c \in \cat{C}$.
Let $R \in \cov{c}$.
Let $s = \mathfam{s}{i}{R}$ be a matching family on $c$ indexed by $R$.
By the cover preserving assumption we know $F(R)$ generates a covering sieve $S$.
Define the natural transformation $T$ by 
\[ s \mapsto \matchfam{t}{j}{S} \]

where $t_j = F(h)s_i$ for some factorisation $j=ih$. 
Such a factorisation always exists since $S$ is generated by $F(R)$.
This assignment is well-defined since $F$ preserves pullbacks, see proof of \cite[Lemma 2.3.3]{elephant}.

Let $t=\matchfam{t}{j}{S}$ be a matching family on $F(c)$.
By cover lifting property we get a covering sieve $R$ such that $F(R)\subset S$.
The inverse of $T$ is the assignment
\[ t \to \matchfam{s}{i}{R}.\]

This is independent of the choice of $R$ because ..
These are mutually inverse because ...
\end{proof}
