\begin{lemma}[Restriction commutes with plus]
The transformation $s_{\presheaf{F}}$ is an isomorphism of functors.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We use the variables from definition ?.
The morphism $s_{\presheaf{F},f}$ has an inverse, 
again sending the set to itself and applying $Q^f$ on the indexing sieve.
These are mutual inverses, 
so $s_{\presheaf{F},f}$ is an isomorphism for each $f$.
\end{proof}
