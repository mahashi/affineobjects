\begin{definition}[Over ringed site]\label[definition]{c93}
Let $Y = \rsite{C}{T}{O}$ be a ringed site.
Let $a\in \cat{C}$.
Define the ringed site $Y_a$ to be 
the site $\overcat{C}{a}$ with the structure sheaf $\direct{u}\sheaf{O}$
where $u: \overcat{C}{a} \rightarrow \cat{C}$ the forgetful functor.
This makes sense because $u$ is continuous, see \Cref{da8}.

Whenever $u$ is used as a morphism between ringed sites it stands 
for the morphism of ringed sites $(u,\id)$ as defined in \Cref{bdc}.
