\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{d49}
Let $\cat{C}$ be a category.
Let $a,b\in \cat{C}$.
Let $(x_i)_T$ be a matching family for some presheaf $\presheaf{F}$ on $b$
indexed by sieve $T$.
For any $f:b \rightarrow a$ the family
$(x_i)_{T^f}$ is matching again.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $u: \overcat{C}{a} \rightarrow \cat{C}$ be the localization functor.
Only when a domain has an `a' as subscript, is it taken in $\overcat{C}{a}$.

We have $x_{i} \in \sections{\dom{i}}{\presheaf{F}}$.
Hence also $x_{i} \in \sections{fi}{\presheaf{F}u} = \sections{\dom{i}_a}{\presheaf{F}u}$,
where now $i$ is considered as a morphism in $\overcat{C}{a}$.
Note that 
\[(\presheaf{F}u)(p)(x_{i}) 
	= \presheaf{F}(p)(x_{i}) =x_{i \circ p}
\]
for any $p:c \rightarrow \dom{i}$,
since $(x_{i})_T$ is a matching family in $\cat{C}$.
\end{proof}
