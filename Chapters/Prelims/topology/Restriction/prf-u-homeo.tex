\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{b17}
The functor $u:\overcat{C}{a} \rightarrow \cat{C}$ is a morphism of sites that is cover lifting.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Clearly $u$ preserves pullbacks.
By remark ? it is also immediate that $u$ preserves pullbacks and lifts covers.
\end{proof}


% \begin{remark}\label[remark]{b20}
% The biggest Grothendieck topology making a 
% Let $\top{T}$ be a Grothendieck topology on $\overcat{C}{a}$
% that makes $u$ cover lifting and preserving.
% Let $c\xrightarrow{f} a \in \overcat{C}{a}$.
% Let $R\in \cov{(c,f)}$ for $\top{T}$.
% By assumption $u(R)$ generates a covering sieve, hence $R$

% The induced topology is the biggest topology on $\overcat{C}{a}$ 
% such that $u:\overcat{C} \rightarrow \cat{C}$
% is cover lifting and preserving.
