\begin{definition}[Site]\label[definition]{Site}
A site $\site{C}{T}$ is a category $\cat{C}$ with a Grothendieck topology $\top{T}$.
A morphism of sites is a functor that preserves finite limits and covers.

The category $\sites$ has as objects sites and morphisms of sites as just defined.
When no confusion can arise then we will use $\cat{C}$ to denote the whole site $\site{C}{T}$.
