\begin{definition}[Site]
A site $\site{C}{T}$ is a category $\cat{C}$ with a Grothendieck topology $\top{T}$.
A morphism of sites $G: \site{C}{T} \rightarrow \site{D}{S}$ 
is a functor $G':\cat{C} \rightarrow \cat{D}$ such that 

A functor $G':\cat{C} \rightarrow \cat{D}$ is called cover-preserving
if for every covering sieve $R$, the family
$\set{G'(f) | f\in R}$ generates a $S$-covering sieve.

The category $\sites$ has as objects sites and as morphisms cover-preserving functors.
When no confusion can arise then we will use $\cat{C}$ to denote the whole site $\site{C}{T}$.
