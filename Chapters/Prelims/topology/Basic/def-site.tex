\begin{definition}[Site]\label[definition]{a17}
A site $\site{C}{T}$ is a category $\cat{C}$ with a Grothendieck topology $\top{T}$.
A morphism of sites is a functor that preserves pullbacks and covers.

The category $\sites$ has as objects sites and morphisms of sites as just defined.
When no confusion can arise then we will use $\cat{C}$ to denote the whole site $\site{C}{T}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label[remark]{a1f}
In most resources a morphism of sites is defined to preserve all finite limits.
To get the results that we want we only need preservation of pullbacks and
we need the forgetful functor $\overcat{C}{a}\rightarrow C$ to be a morphism of sites,
hence this slightly weaker notion than usual.
