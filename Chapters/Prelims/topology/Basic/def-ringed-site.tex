\begin{definition}[Ringed sites]
A ringed site $\rsite{C}{T}{O}$ is the site $\site{C}{T}$ with the sheaf of rings $\sheaf{O}$ on it.

The category $\ringedsites$ has as objects ringed sites 
and as morphisms pairs $\pair{f}{f^#}$ 
with $f: \site{C}{T} \rightarrow \site{D}{S}$ a morphism of sites
and $f^#: \direct{f}\sheaf{U} \rightarrow \sheaf{O}$ a morphism of sheaf of rings.
We will denote the pair $\pair{f}{f^#}$ by just $f$ when no confusion can arise.
