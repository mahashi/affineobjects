\begin{definition}[Small site]\label[definition]{9b8}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
We will define the site $\site{\Open{X}}{T}$.
The underlying category $\Open{X}$ is the poset of opens of $T$.
Note that $\Open{X}$ has pullbacks, so we may define a basis for a Grothendieck topology.
A family of maps $\set{U_i \xrightarrow{f_i} U}$ is a covering family if $\Union_i U_i = U$.

Whenever a sheaf is said to be on a topological space, the sheaf is actually defined on this site.
