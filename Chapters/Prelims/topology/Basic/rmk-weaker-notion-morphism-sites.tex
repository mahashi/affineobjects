\begin{remark}\label[remark]{c58}
In most resources a morphism of sites is defined to preserve all finite limits.
To get the results that we want we only need preservation of pullbacks and
we need the forgetful functor $\overcat{C}{a}\rightarrow C$ to be a morphism of sites,
hence this slightly weaker notion than usual.
