\begin{definition}[continuous functor]\label[definition]{99b}
Let $G:\cat{C} \rightarrow \cat{D}$ be a functor between sites.
Let $c\in \cat{C}$ and let $R$ be a covering sieve on $c$.
The functor $G$ is said to preserves covers if $G(R)$ generates a covering sieve.
It is enough to check that $G$ sends covering families to covering families,
if the topology of the sites is defined by a basis.
If $G$ also preserves pullbacks then we call it continuous.
See \cite[Tag 00WV]{stacks}.
