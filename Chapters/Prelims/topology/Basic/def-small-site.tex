\begin{example}[small site]\label[example]{small site}
Let $X$ be a topological space.
Let the category $\opens{X}$ consist of the opens of $X$ as objects 
and inclusion as the morphisms.
Define a basis on this site consisting of the families $\set{U_i \rightarrow U}$
such that $\Union_i U_i = U_i$.
A continouous map $f:X\rightarrow Y$
induces a morphism of sites $\opens{Y} \rightarrow \opens{X}$
by sending $U \to \inverse{f}(U)$.
In this way you can embed the category of topological spaces 
into the category of sites.

If $X$ is a ringed space 
we can turn the site $\opens{X}$ into a ringed site
by setting the sheaf of rings of $X$
to be the sheaf of rings of $\opens{X}$.
