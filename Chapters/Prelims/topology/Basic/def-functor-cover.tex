%TODO: question - What do we need more than cover preserving for a functor to commute with sheafifying.
\begin{definition}
Let $G:\cat{C} \rightarrow \cat{D}$ be a functor between sites.
Let $c\in \cat{C}$ and let $R$ be a covering sieve on $c$.
$G$ induces a map $\sieves{c} \rightarrow \sieves{G(c)}$
by sending a sieve $R$ to the sieve generated by $G(R)$.
The functor $G$ is said to preserves covers or called cover-preserving 
if the induced map restricts to a map $\cov{c} \rightarrow \cov{G(c)}$.
\end{definition}
