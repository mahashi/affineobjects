\begin{definition}\label[definition]{956}
Let $\sheaf{F}$ be a sheaf of modules on $\rsite{C}{T}{O}$.
It is called quasi-coherent if the following holds.
For any object $a\in\cat{C}$ 
there exists a covering sieve $S$ 
such that for any map $f:b\rightarrow a$ in $S$ 
there exists a (global) presentation
\[\restrict{b}{\sheaf{O}}^{\coproduct I} \rightarrow \restrict{b}{\sheaf{O}}^{\coproduct J} 
	\rightarrow \restrict{b}{\sheaf{F}} \rightarrow 0\]

It is enough to have presentation for a generating set of $S$.
Some also call this property that $\sheaf{F}$ is locally presentable.

Quasi-coherent modules form a full subcategory 
of the category of sheaves of modules over $\rsite{C}{T}{O}$ 
which are denoted by $\qcoh{O}$.
