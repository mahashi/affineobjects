\begin{example}\label[example]{961}
Let $\rsite{C}{T}{O}$ be a ringed site.
Let $a\in \cat{C}$.
Consider the morphism of ringed sites $u:\overcat{C}{a}\rightarrow \cat{C}$.
Note that $u^{\#} = \id$ and by \Cref{cb9} it lifts covers.
So all the results from this section apply.
This is the most important case.
