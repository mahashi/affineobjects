\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{704}
Let $F:\site{C}{T} \rightarrow \site{D}{S}$
be a morphism of sites that lift covers.
Then $\direct{F} \plus = \plus \direct{F}$ 
and hence also $\direct{F} \circ \sheafify = \sheafify \circ \direct{F}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $c \in \cat{C}$.
Let $R \in \cov{c}$.
Let $\presheaf{G}$ be a presheaf on $\cat{D}$.
Let $s = \matchfam{s}{i}{R}$ be a matching family in $\direct{F}\presheaf{G}$ 
on $c$ indexed by $R$. So $s_i \in \sect{F(\dom{i})}{G}$.
By the cover preserving assumption we know $F(R)$ generates a covering sieve $S$ on $F(c)$.
Define the natural transformation $T: \direct{F}\plus \rightarrow \plus \direct{F}$ by 
\[ s \mapsto \matchfam{t}{j}{S} \]

where $t_j = F(h)s_i$ for some factorisation $j=F(i)h$. 
Such a factorisation always exists since $S$ is generated by $F(R)$.
This assignment is well-defined since $F$ preserves pullbacks, see proof of \cite[Lemma 2.3.3]{elephant}.

We will prove that $T$ is injective.
Let $s' = \matchfam{s'}{i}{R'}$.
Assume $T(s)=T(s')$
then $\matchfam{t}{j}{S} = \matchfam{t'}{j'}{S'}$,
hence there exists covering sieve $Q \subset S\intersect S'$
such that $t_k = t'_k$ for every $k\in Q$.
Since $F$ lifts covers, there exists covering sieve $P\subset R\intersect R'$ on $c$
such that $F(P)$ generates a sieve $P'\subset Q$.
Hence $t_k = F(h)s_k = F(h)s'_k = t'_k$ with $k\in P'$ and $k=F(k)h$.
Take $h=\id$ to conclude that $s=s'$ on $P$, hence they are in the same equivalence class.

Now comes surjectivity.
Let $t = \matchfam{t}{j}{S}\in..$ on $F(c)$.
We get a covering sieve $R$ such that $F(R)\subset S$.
Consider this matching family now on the covering sieve generated by $F(R)$, which amounts to taking a different representing element from the equivalence class. So now $F(R)$ generates $S$.
For any $j\in S$ we get a factorisation $j=F(i)h$ for some $i\in R$.
We want to have $s_i = t_{F(i)}$. 
This produces a matching family because restriction in $\direct{F}\presheaf{G}$ is exactly the same as in $\presheaf{G}$.
Note that now $T(s) = t$. Hence we got surjectivity.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}\label[example]{72e}
The morphism of ringed sites $u$ satisfies the conditions of \Cref{704}
and so commutes with sheafification.
\end{example}

\begin{corollary}\label[corollary]{733}
We have $\direct{F}\omega = \omega$ and hence also $\direct{F}\omega^2=\omega^2$
\end{corollary}

% \begin{proof}
% For any section $x \in \sections{b}{F}$.
% Let $x_i = \presheaf{F}(i)(x)$ for any morphism $i \in \cat{C}$. 
% Note that $\maxsieve{f} = \maxsieve{b}$.
% This implies that the compatible family $\set{x_i}$ indexed by the maximal sieve on $f$
% is sent by $s$ to the same set $\set{x_i}$ indexed by the maximal sieve on $b$.
% In diagram form, that
