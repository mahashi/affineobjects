\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{471}
Let $\sheaf{F}$ be a sheaf of modules on scheme $X$.
Then $\sheaf{F}$ is quasi-coherent \iff 
for any $D(f) = \Spec{S_f} \rightarrow \Spec{S}$ opens in $X$ with $f\in S$ 
the induced map
\[ \sect{\Spec{S}}{F} \tensor_{S} S_f \rightarrow \sect{D(f)}{F}\]
is an isomorphism.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
$\Rightarrow$:

Assume $\sheaf{F}$ is quasi-coherent.
Let $\Spec{S}\subset X$ be a open affine subset.
By \Cref{7ed} we have $\restr{\Spec{S}}{\sheaf{F}} = \widetilde{M}$
for some $S$-module $M$.
By construction $\sect{D(f)}{F} = M_f$ and hence the induced map is an isomorphism
by basic commutative algebra.

$\Leftarrow$:

Assume that the induced map  is an isomorphism
for every $f\in S$ with $\Spec{S}\subset X$ open affine subset.
Choose collection $f_i$ such that $(f_i)=(1)$.
Then $\sect{D(f_i)}{F} = \sect{\Spec{S}}{F} \tensor_{S} S_{f_i}$ by assumption.
Hence $\restr{\Spec{S}}{F} = \widetilde{M}$
with $M = \sect{\Spec{S}}{F}$.
By \Cref{7ed} this implies that $\sheaf{F}$ is quasi-coherent.
