\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
Quasi-coherent sheaves and affine schemes have a special relationship. One can find out that a sheaf of modules on any scheme is quasi-coherent by looking at the sections at the affine open subsets. One can find out that a quasi-compact scheme is affine by proving all higher cohomology of any quasi-coherent scheaf vanishes \cite[Tag 01XF]{stacks}. 

\section{Aim}
This thesis will investigate 
and formalize this special relationship in 
a definition that only depends on the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a scheme. This then generalizes to any ringed site, which gives us a notion of `affine' object, which we will call \textbf{caffine}, shorthand for categorically affine.
We will investigate how fruitful this definition is in other contexts.

I assume the reader is familiar with basic categorical notions such as limits and adjunctions, 
everything that is in the first 3 chapters of \cite{catsUU}.
