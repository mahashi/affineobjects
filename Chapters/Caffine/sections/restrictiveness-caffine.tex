\subsection{Restrictive maps between caffine objects}

\begin{lemma}[Morphism between caffines is restrictive]
Let $b\xrightarrow{f} a \in \cat{C}$ be a morphism between caffine objects, then $f$ is restrictive.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Co-unit is iso when locally iso]
Let $a\in \cat{C}$ be an object. 
Let $\cover{b_i}{a}$ be a restrictive caffine cover, then $\epsilon$ is a natural isomorphism.
\end{lemma}
