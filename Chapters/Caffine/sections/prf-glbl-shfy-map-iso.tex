\begin{lemma}
Let $\rsite{C}{T}{O}$ be a ringed site.
Let $a$ be caffine.
Let $M$ be a $\sections{a}{O}$-module.
The component $\omega^2{\pstilde{M},a}$ at $a$ 
of the sheafification morphism $\omega^2_{\stilde{M}}: \pstilde{M} \rightarrow \stilde{M}$ 
is equal to the unit of $\adj{\stilde}{\globalsections}$ in $\overcat{C}{a}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the following maps, which you get by repeatedly calling on an adjunction.

\[\id :\stilde(M) \rightarrow \stilde(M)\]
\[\omega^2_{\stilde{M}} : \pstilde(M) \rightarrow \stilde(M) 
	\mbox{ use sheafification adjunction, see lemma ..}
\]
\[\omega^2_{\pstilde{M},a} M \rightarrow \sections{a}{\stilde(M)} \mbox{ take sections at $a$}\]

We took the adjunct of $\id$ wrt the sheafification adjunction as the first step.
Then we took the adjunct of the result wrt the $\pstilde$ ajunction.
Hence we get the adjunct of $\id$ wrt the $\stilde$ adjunction.
so the last map is actually the unit of the $\stilde$ adjunction.
This map is an isomorphism because we assume $a$ to be caffine.
\end{proof}
