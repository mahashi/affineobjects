\chapter{Caffine objects}

In this chapter we will define the property affineness for an object in any ringed sites.
This will be called `caffine'. We will prove that caffine and affine are equivalent in the ringed site of schemes.
Lastly, we introduce the notion of enough affines.
If this conditions holds then a sheaf is quasi-coherent \iff it is locally $\stilde{M}$ for any caffine object and some (non-)examples.
