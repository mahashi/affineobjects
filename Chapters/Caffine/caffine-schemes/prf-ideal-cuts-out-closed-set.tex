\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{1cc}
Let $I \subset \sect{X}{O}$ be an ideal.
The set $V_X(I)$ is closed.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Consider the exact sequence 
\[\sheaf{O}(X)\rightarrow \frac{\sheaf{O}(X)}{I} \rightarrow 0.\]
The functor $\stilde$ is a left adjoint hence right exact so 
\[\sheaf{O} \xrightarrow{f} \stilde(\frac{\sheaf{O}(X)}{I}) \rightarrow 0\]
is exact.
Hence the sequence
\[\sheaf{O}_x \xrightarrow{f_x} \stilde(\frac{\sheaf{O}(X)}{I})_x \rightarrow 0\]
is exact. 
The global section $f(1)$ must generate $\stilde(\frac{\sheaf{O}(X)}{I})$ as a module by surjectivity of $f$.
Similarly $f_x(1_x)$ generates $\stilde(\frac{\sheaf{O}(X)}{I})_x$.

Note that $f_x(1_x) = f(1)_x$ by definition of $f_x$, hence $f(1)_x$ is a generating element.
Hence $\stilde(\frac{\sheaf{O}(X)}{I})_x \neq 0$ \iff $f(1)_x \neq 0$. 

This implies $V_X(I) = \Sup(f(1))$ which makes $V_X(I)$ closed as the support of a global section.
\end{proof}
