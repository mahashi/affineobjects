\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{19a}
The sets $D_X(a)$ form a basis for the topology of $X$,
with $a$ a global section.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $U\subset X$ be any open. Let $x\in U$.
By lemma ? we get $I$ such that $V_X(I) = \compl{U}$.
It follows that $x\not\in V_X(I)$ and $I\not\subset \ker(x)$.
So we get a $g\in I$ with $g\not\in \ker(x)$.
We get $x\in D_X(g)$ and by corollary ?%TODO 
$D_X(g) \subset U$.
As stated earlier, $D_X(ab) = D_X(a) \cap D_X(b)$ since $\ker(x)$ is a prime ideal.
So $D_X(a)$ form a basis.
\end{proof}
