\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{3cf}
Let $\Ip\subset R$ be a prime ideal.
The closed set $V_X(\Ip)$ is irreducible.
This implies that $\counit_X$ is injective.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $z\in X$.
Assume that $\counit_X(z)=\Ip$. 
So $\ker{z} = \Ip$.
Let $y\in V_X(\Ip)$. 
Then $\ker(z) \subset \ker(y)$, hence if $y \in D_X(a)$ then $z \in D_X(a)$.
Therefore $z$ is contained in any open subset of $V_X(\Ip)$, 
hence it is irreducible.
Note that $z$ is its unique generic point since the biggest closed subset of $V_X(\Ip)$ not containing $z$ is the empty set.
This shows that $\counit_X$ is injective.
\end{proof}
