\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{3f1}
The counit $\counit_X$ is open, hence a homeomorphism.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since $\counit_X$ is a morphism of locally ringed spaces, if $a\not in \ker{x}$ then $a\not \in \ker{\counit_X(x)}$.
Hence
$\counit_X(D_X(a))= \{\counit_X(x) \st a\not\in \ker(x)\} = \counit_X(X) \intersect D_{\Spec R}(a) = D_{\Spec R}(a)$.
Our map $\counit_X$ is continuous and open, so a homeomorphism.
\end{proof}
