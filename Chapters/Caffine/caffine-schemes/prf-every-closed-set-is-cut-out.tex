\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{1a8}
Every closed set $W \subset X$ can be written as $V_X(I)$ for some ideal $I \subset \sect{x}{O}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\sheaf{I}$ be some ideal sheaf inducing a closed subscheme structure on $W$.
This is always a quasi-coherent module.
Let $I = \sect{x}{I}$. 
Since $X$ is caffine, we get $\sheaf{I} = \stilde{I}$.
Let $\sheaf{O}_W$ be the structure sheaf of this closed subscheme. 
Consider the closed immersion $W\xrightarrow{i} X$.
By construction $\sheaf{I} \rightarrow \sheaf{O} \rightarrow \direct{i}\sheaf{O}_W \rightarrow 0$ is exact, hence $\direct{i}\sheaf{O}_W = \frac{\sheaf{O}}{\sheaf{I}}$.
Hence $V_X(I) = \Supp(\direct{i}\sheaf{O}_W) = W $
\end{proof}
