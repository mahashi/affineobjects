Let $b\rightarrow a$ and $\module{F}$ a module sheaf on $\cat{C}/a$.
Then
\[\restr{\Tildefunctor{\sections{a}{F}}}{b} = \Tildefunctor{\sections{a}{F} \tensor_{\sections{a}{O}} \sections{b}{O}}}\]
and
\[\epsilon_b(\restr{\module{F}}{B}) = \restr{\epsilon(\module{F})}{b}.\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Sheafification commutes with restriction so $\restr{\Tildefunctor{\sections{a}{F}}}{b} = \sheafify{c: \sections{a}{F} \tensor \sections{c}{O}}$ with $c\rightarrow b$. Note that this is the sheafification of exactly the same presheaf that $\Tildefunctor{\sections{a}{F} \tensor_{\sections{a}{O}} \sections{b}{O}}}$ is the sheafification of.

Both maps are defined by

\[d: m \tensor r \mapsto mr\]
