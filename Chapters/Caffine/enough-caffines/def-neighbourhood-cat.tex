\begin{definition}[Neighbourhood site]\label[definition]{264}
Let $X$ be a topological space 
and $\Open{X}$ the corresponding category of open subsets.
Let $y\in X$. 
Define the category $N(y)$ to be the full subcategory of $Open{X}$ of all neighbourhoods $U$ of $y$.
A family $\cover{U_i}{U}$ is covering on $U$ if it is covering in $\Open{X}$.
