\begin{definition}[Neighbourhood site]\label[definition]{267}
Let $X$ be a topological space 
and $\opens{X}$ the corresponding category of open subsets.
Let $y\in X$. 
Define the category $N(y)$ to be the full subcategory of $\opens{X}$ of all neighbourhoods $U$ of $y$.
A family $\cover{U_i}{U}$ is covering on $U$ in $N(y)$ if it is covering in $\opens{X}$.
Note that $i: N(y) \rightarrow \opens{X}$ is a morphism of sites.

Assume that $X$ is a ringed space coming with a structure sheaf $\sheaf{O}$.
Define $\sheaf{O}_{X,y} = \direct{i}\sheaf{O}$. This is a sheaf as mentioned in \Cref{962}.
