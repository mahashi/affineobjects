\section{Enough caffines}
For schemes a quasi-coherent module often is defined
by a module that over affine schemes is of the form $\stilde{M}$
for some module $M$. We will look how often this generalizes,
which we will do through the notion of `enough caffines'.
We will see some examples where it does not work as in $\schemes$ 
and some results about when it does.
