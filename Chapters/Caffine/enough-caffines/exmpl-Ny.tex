%%% Example moved to N(y) setting
Let $X,f_j$ and $U_n$ be as in \Cref{26e}.
Note that $\coproduct_i \sheaf{O}_{X,y}$ is quasi-coherent.

%%Define \alpha
Set $y=0\in X$.
Define the sheaf map 
\[\coproduct_i O_{X_y} \xrightarrow{\alpha} \coproduct_{ij} O_{X_y},\]
\[e_i \mapsto \sum_{j} f_i \indicator_{L_j} e_{ij}.\]

%%Proof \alpha is well-defined
Fix $i$. We will prove that $\alpha_X(e_i)$ is a well-defined global section.
Choose $m>i$. Let $V_k=L_k\cup U_m$ and note that $\Union_k V_k = X$.
By construction $f_i$ is zero on $U_m$, hence $f_i \indicator_{L_j}$ is zero on $V_k$ if $k\neq j$ and so $\sum_{j} f_i \indicator_{L_j} e_{ij} = f_i\indicator{L_k}e_{ik}$ on $V_k$.
This shows that $\alpha_X(e_i)$ is a well-defined section on any element of the cover $\cover{V_k}{X}$ and
this family is matching since the sections are functions and the 'restriction' maps are actual restriction.

%%Absence of a \beta for every element
Let $V \in N(y)$.
Assume there exists $\beta: \coproduct_i \Gamma(V,O_{X,y}) \rightarrow \coproduct_{ij} \Gamma(V,O_{X,y})$ such that $\Lambda(\beta)=\alpha_V$.
Then $\alpha_V(e_i)=\sum_{j} f_i \indicator_{L_j} e_{ij}$ is not just locally finite over some cover that may depend on $i$, but actually finite globally on $V$ for all $i$.
So almost all $f_i \indicator_{L_j}$ are zero on $V$. 
Note that $y\in V$, so $U_d\subset V$ for some $d$. 
Let $i>2d$, then $f_i\neq 0$ on $(-\frac{1}{d},\frac{1}{d})$ and so $f_i \indicator_{L_j}\neq 0$ on $U_d$ for any $j$.
Hence $\alpha_V(e_i)=\sum_{j} f_i \indicator_{L_j} e_{ij}$ is not a finite sum for $i>2d$. 
This contradicts our assumption, so $\alpha$ does not come 

%%Conclude no element is affine
The restriction of any quasi-coherent sheaf is quasi-coherent. 
Observe that $\alpha$, and its restrictions, is a morphism between quasi-coherent sheafs but does not come from a map of modules by the previous contradiction.
Therefore $\stilde$ is not full for any $V$ and so no object $V$ is caffine in $N(y)$.
