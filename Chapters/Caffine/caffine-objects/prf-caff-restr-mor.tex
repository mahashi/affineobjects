\begin{theorem}[Morphism between caffines is restrictive]\label[theorem]{11e}
Let $Y = \rsite{C}{T}{O}$.
Let $f: b \rightarrow a \in \cat{C}$ be a morphism between caffine objects, 
then $f$ is restrictive.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\module{F}$ be a quasi-coherent module on $\oversite{Y}{a}$.
Let $M = \sections{a}{F}$.
Since $a$ is caffine, we have $\sheaf{F} = \stilde{M}$.

We have to show that
\[\widehat{f}:\sections{a}{F} \tensor_{\sections{a}{O}} \sections{b}{O} \rightarrow \sections{b}{F}\]
is an isomorphism, where $\widehat{f}$ as defined in \Cref{caa}.

Note that \widehat{f} is the component at $b$ of the natural transformation $\omega^2_{\pstilde{\globalsections{F}}}$.
Since $b$ is caffine, this component is an isomorphism by \Cref{14d}.
\end{proof}
