\begin{lemma}[Restrictive to affines]\label[lemma]{Restrictive to affines}
If $f:X \rightarrow \Spec{R}$ is a restrictive open immersion. 
then $X$ is affine.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since $X$ is an open in $\Spec{R}$, we get a distinguised covering $\Union_i D(f_i) = X$ with $f_i\in R$.
We will prove that $(f_i) = (1)$ in $S = \sect{X}{O}$ and 
then invoke the result from Ex. 2.1.7 in \cite{harts}.

Consider $M = \frac{R}{(f_i)}$ as an $R$-module and look at $\stilde{M}$.
By restrictiveness we get $M \tensor_R S = \stilde{M}(S)$ and  
by $M \tensor_R R_{f_i} = \stilde{M}(D(f_i)) = M_{f_i} = 0$. 
Hence $\stilde{M}(S) = 0$ by the sheaf axiom.
This implies that $(f_i) = (1)$ in $S$.
\end{proof}
