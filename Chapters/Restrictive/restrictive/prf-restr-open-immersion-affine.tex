\begin{lemma}[Restrictive to affines]\label[lemma]{Restrictive to affines}
If $f:X \rightarrow \Spec{R}$ is a restrictive open immersion. 
then $X$ is affine.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
%TODO: remember proof
%TODO: read about affiness being a local property: if a cover of dist opens has it and this cover generates the unit ideal then the scheme has it
\end{proof}
