\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{3}
Any morphism $\Spec{S} \xrightarrow{f} \Spec{R} \in \overcat{Sch}{\Spec{R}}$ 
between affine schemes is restrictive.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\sheaf{G}$ be a quasi-coherent module on $\overschemes{\Spec{R}}$.
Set $M = \sect{\Spec{R}}{G}$.
We want to prove that 
\[
\widehat{f}:M \tensor_{R} S \rightarrow \sect{\Spec{S}}{G}
\]
is an isomorphism.

By lemma ?, we get $\sheaf{G} = \stilde{M}$.
As said in definition ?, in this case $\widehat{f} = \omega^2_{\Spec{S}}$.
By lemma ?, we know that $\omega^2$ is an isomorphism at affine schemes.
\end{proof}
