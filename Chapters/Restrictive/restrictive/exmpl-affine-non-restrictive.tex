\begin{example}[Affine non-restrictive map]
Consider the canonical inclusions $\affspace{i} \rightarrow \projspace{i}$
and the shifted quasi-coherent module $\sheaf{O}(-1)$.
This module is even locally free of degree 1, this is often called an invertible module.

The global sections of the module $\sheaf{O}(-1)$ are the elements of degree $-1$
in the global sections of $\sheaf{O}$. There are no such elements, hence the global sections are the zero module.

On $\affspace{i}$ all invertible modules are isomorphic to the structure sheaf. %TODO: reference
We conclude that the canonical inclusions cannot be restrictive.

Any inclusion $\Spec{\kappa(\Ip)} \rightarrow \projspace{i}$ of a point is not restrictive which can be shown with the same argument.

This is a (more opaque) way of saying that on projective space 
not every quasi-coherent sheaf is generated by global sections.
