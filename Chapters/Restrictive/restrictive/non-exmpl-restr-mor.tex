\begin{example}\label[example]{f7e}
Let $R$ be a ring.
Consider the open immersion $U = \Spec{R[x,y]} \setminus \set{(x,y)} \rightarrow \Spec{R[x,y]}$
and the quasi-coherent sheaf $\sheaf{G} = \stilde(\frac{R[x,y]}{xy})$.
The global sections of this sheaf are $\frac{R[x,y]}{xy}$,
as shown in \Cref{afb}.

Define $U_1 = D(x) \rightarrow U$ 
and $U_2 = D(y) \rightarrow U$. 
Note that these cover $U$ together.
We have $\sect{U_1}{G} = 0$ and $\sect{U_1}{G} = 0$,
since $\frac{R[x,y]}{xy}_x = 0$ and $\frac{R[x,y]}{xy}_y = 0$.
Hence since $\sheaf{G}$ is a sheaf, we get $\sect{U}{G} = 0$.

The sections over $U$ of $\stilde{R[x,y]}$ are (also) $R[x,y]$. See \cite[4.4.1]{vakil}. 
We conclude that $\gblsect{G} \tensor_{\gblsect{O}} \sect{U}{O} \rightarrow \sect{U}{G}$
is not an isomorphism.
