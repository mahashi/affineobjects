\begin{example}
Let $R$ be a ring.
Consider the open immersion $U = \Spec{R[x,y]} \setminus \set{\idealgen{x,y}} \rightarrow \Spec{R[x,y]}$
and the quasi-coherent sheaf $\sheaf{G} = \stilde(\frac{R[x,y]}{xy})$.
The global sections of this sheaf are $\frac{R[x,y]}{xy}$, because for affine schemes the counit is an isomorphism.

Define $U_1 = D(x) \rightarrow U$ and $U_2 = D(y) \rightarrow U$. 
Note that these cover $U$ together.
We have $\sect{U_1}{G} = 0$ and $\sect{U_1}{G} = 0$, since $\frac{R[x,y]}{xy}_x = 0$ and $\frac{R[x,y]}{xy}_y = 0$.
Hence since $\sheaf{G}$ is a sheaf, we get $\sect{U}{G} = 0$.%TODO: introduce kernel definition of sheaf property

The sections over $U$ of $\stilde{R[x,y]}$ are (also) $R[x,y]$. %TODO: write this out
We conclude that $\gblsect{G} \tensor_{\gblsect{O}} \sect{U}{O} \rightarrow \sect{U}{G}$
is not an isomorphism.
