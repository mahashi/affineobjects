%TODO: define strong restrictive family in chapter 2 as a collection of maps for which the above lemma holds in an arbitrary category.
\chapter{Restrictive}
This section will introduce the notion of a restrictive morphism
We will see some examples, non-examples and results in the category of schemes
and see that this notion is closely related to affinenes.

For some of the examples and results see the chapter on quasi-coherent modules in \cite{vakil}.
