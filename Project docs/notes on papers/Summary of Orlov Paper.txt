%Sites 
Definition. A ringed site.
Definition. Sheaf modules.

%General modules section
Pullback, restricting.(pushforward, extension functors?)
Abelian, enough injectives,..

%Cokernels
Locally free modules.
Cokernel definition of quasi-coherence.'Small cocompletion'. 
Category is (small?) cocomplete.

%Ass. modules
Definition. Tilde functor.
Definition. Quasi-coherent presheaf module. (Orlov)
Fully faithfull embedding of modules in module presheafs.
Lemma. Tilde is left adjoint to global sections.
Definition. Quasi-coherent module on a presheaf.
Use of sheafification after tilde, adjunction is preserved but no longer full. This is exact since both functors are.
Work out why Sheafification is exact.
Lemma. qc modules are cokernels of free modules locally. Hence qc modules \subset cokernels.
Lemma. qc modules restricted/pullbacked are qc modules.

%Affines
Example. For the affine site, the tilde|global sections adjunctions is an equivalence only for every representable.
Implies sheafification is full*.
Define. affines in any site as the presheafs/objects such that tilde|global sections is an equivalence.(possible extra condition: qc presheaf module is sheaf)

Question. For which sites is a module qc (cokernel) iff it is qc (cokernel)= ass. mod pulledback to each affine?
Need descent to work.

Step 1. When is an object affine?
Examples: Affine schemes, any object such that the comma category is the terminal cat. 

Let U be compact. Then \bigsum_i \sheaf{O}(U) = \bigsum_i (\sheaf{O}(U)). 
Hence any sheaf map between coproducts of the structure sheaf, even infinite, come from a 'matrix'.
