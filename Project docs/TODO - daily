Done - Define Kappa        
Done - Kappa is ff
Done - Proof adjunction Kappa with globalsections
Done - Changed xymatrix in definition of presheaf modules
Done - Define Lambda
Done - Proof composition of adjunctions fact
Done - conclude that Lambda is the adjunct of globalsections composed with i

- Setup functor macros that work without parameters
- Define natural transformations and their notation
- Define globalsections functor and say that we suppress the composition with the inclusion functor.
- Give explicitely the unit-counit for pstilde and stilde
- Proof the counit of stilde is the globalsections component of the sheafification functor
