Done - Define pstilde        
Done - pstilde is ff
Done - Proof adjunction pstilde with globalsections
Done - Changed xymatrix in definition of presheaf modules
Done - Define stilde
Done - Proof composition of adjunctions fact
Done - conclude that stilde is the adjunct of globalsections composed with i
Done - We will prove that global component of the universal sheafification morphism is an isomorphism.
Done - $S, T$ are still sieves on $fg$
Done - this is a compatible family
Done - injective and surjectivity of $s$
Done - naturality of $s$
Done - Proof \sheafify \restrict = \restrict \sheafify
Done - Enable building from any file
Done - Proof commutativity of triangle.
Done - Proof the counit(or unit?) of stilde is the globalsections component of the sheafification functor
Done - Look up definition of induced topology on localized site. Show that by definition covering sieves stay 			covering.
Done - Fix issue "I can't write on file 'main.pdf'"
Done - Install and configure TexLive
Done - Download Latexing docs.

= Latex
- Setup functor macros that work without parameters
- Setup symbols in tikz cd : http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/279187/adjunction-of-functors-command-tikzcd/279192
- Add names and references to lemmas/definitions/examples
- Clean preamble
- Remove nesting of macros for functors.

= Project
- Clean project
- Put everything back and make it build

= Prelims
- Define natural transformations and their notation
- Define globalsections functor and say that we suppress the composition with the inclusion functor.
- section functors and restricting/localizing commute
- canonical way to write restricting/localizing.
- Extent localizing/restricting to sites

= Topology
- Proof/reference oostens diktaat properties of plus.
- localizing a Site definition

= Caffines x restrictive
- exhibit iso and show that pullback along u and and u commute
- Make diagram of dependencies
