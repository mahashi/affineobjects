- sheaves commute with directed limits?
Bewijs dat de sheafification eindige limiten bewaard
Wat zijn de eisen op een preshoof op Aff om een schema te zijn? Gevraagd aan David holmes, geen fijn antwoord.
What is the analogue of stalks in a ringed site? The stalk of an object A on a point x is the inverse image of A under this geometric morphism. 
What is the analogue of the cokernel description for vector bundles?
Is every qc sheaf a cokernel of locally free sheaves globally?
What are the global sections of the sheaf of rings on a presheaf? Mathoverflow. http://mathoverflow.net/questions/204452/induced-topology-on-site-reconstructing-global-sections-of-a-scheme-orlov
 - Why does the inverse image functor always have a left and right adjoint? SGA I 5.1 for construction.
 -- Proof of the fact that restricting u_! to representables gives u.
If you look at descent for qc sheaves on fpqc topology, are the image presheaves sheafified wrt this topology or the Zariski?


Is there an elementary proof that only affine schemes are affine objects in the category of schemes?
Are there any sites with no affine objects? Can such sites have non-quasi-coherent sheaves?

When does a functor commute with sheafifying?
When is f^*?
For which maps does the affine scheme proof carry over?
