- Define natural transformations and their notation
- Define globalsections functor and say that we suppress the composition with the inclusion functor.
- canonical way to write restricting/localizing.
- Extent localizing/restricting to sites

= Topology
- Proof/reference oostens diktaat properties of plus.
- What is restriction?
- inverse image, pushforward
- define continuity for functors
- define morphism of sites
- define relative topology as the biggest topology making u continuous
	- work out explicitely with union construction
- oversite definition
- change natural iso from restr-shfy to use matchingfamilies
