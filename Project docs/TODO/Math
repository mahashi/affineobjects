- Use \matchfam everywhere
- induced functor of a morphism on overcategories
- Add refs to all results
- Come up with way to distinguish functors(sheafification, stilde, pstilde) on different categories.
Done - Replace (u \circ) with \direct{u}
- Add domain and codomain to everything
- Supply proofs: restriction commutes with functors(sheafify, tilde, pstilde)
- define composition of natural transformations with functors 
- Write example with spec R
- isomorphism of morphism
- The counit of pstilde is the identity for \pstilde{M} presheaves.
