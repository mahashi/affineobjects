TODO:

- Notational: Over and undercat should contain reference to functor and then stated that this is suppressed.
- Notational: use push forward and push back for the two induced functors on presheaf categories.

DONE:
- Proof that pushforward and sheafification commute.
- Come up with new name for 'affine'.
- Think about/look up examples of ringed spaces that are not affine.
- Write out main adjunction completely, both natural hom-set bijection and the co-unit/unit natural morphisms with the triangle conditions.
- Find definition of subposet that contains a lesser element than any element. = Dense subposet in Alexandroff topology
- Notational: state that sites are denoted by their category when there cannot be any confusion.
