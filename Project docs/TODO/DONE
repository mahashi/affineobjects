Done - Define pstilde
Done - pstilde is ff
Done - Proof adjunction pstilde with globalsections
Done - Changed xymatrix in definition of presheaf modules
Done - Define stilde
Done - Proof composition of adjunctions fact
Done - conclude that stilde is the adjunct of globalsections composed with i
Done - We will prove that global component of the universal sheafification morphism is an isomorphism.
Done - $S, T$ are still sieves on $fg$
Done - this is a compatible family
Done - injective and surjectivity of $s$
Done - naturality of $s$
Done - Proof \sheafify \restrict = \restrict \sheafify
