Done - Define max sieve
- Define sheafification
- Define universal sheafification morphism and choose notation
- Make explicit that \pstilde( M \tensor ...) = \sheafify\restrict\pstilde
- Define adjunctions for pstilde and stilde and give bijections explicitely.
- Rewrite sheafify and restricting commute proof
