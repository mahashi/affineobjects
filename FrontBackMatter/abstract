This thesis will formalize, generalize and investigate 
the special relationship between quasi-coherent sheaves, affine schemes
and the inclusion of distinguised opens into affine schemes.
These 3 notions will be generalized to the context of arbitrary ringed sites
and several results of the scheme case will be proven in the general case.
