\chapter{Further research} %TODO: expand

All the loose ends and open questions are collected in this section.
Let $\cat{C}$ be a ringed site.
Let $a\in \cat{C}$ be a caffine object.
Let $\sheaf{F}$ be a quasi-coherent sheaf on $\overcat{C}{a}$.

\section*{Cohomology}
The vanishing theorem of Serre tells us that all higher cohomology
of quasi-coherent sheaves are zero.\cite[\href{http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01XB}{Tag 01XB}]{stacks}

\begin{question}
Does $H^i(a,\sheaf{F}) = 0$ for all $i>0$ hold?
\end{question}

\section*{Restrictiveness}
Recall the definition of a restrictive morphism from \Cref{c94}.

\begin{question}
Is the pullback of a restrictive morphism restrictive?
\end{question}

\section*{Determining if object is caffine}
It would be nice to have methods to see whether an object is caffine.
We used some counting arguments in the finite case in section 3.3, 
which might be extendable for objects that are quasi-compact in some sense categorical sense.
